## What Kind of Game Is This?

`byte_world_ai` is designed around readable terminal gameplay:
- every prompt shows all currently valid actions,
- combat prompts only show combat-relevant actions,
- interactable entities are color-coded,
- maps and quest hints are always accessible by command.

Main goals:
- defeat the major story bosses,
- rescue and cleanse Elle,
- complete the main questline,
- optionally continue exploring and farming afterward.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Play in browser (recommended)

Open:

`https://joey1399.github.io/byte_world_ai/`

Notes:
- this version is static-hosted on GitHub Pages,
- Python runs in-browser via Pyodide,
- page refresh starts a fresh run (no persistent save yet).

### Option 2: Play local CLI

Requirements:
- Python 3.10+ (3.12+ recommended)

Run:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 3: Preview the web build locally

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

`http://localhost:8000`

## Core Loop

1. Read the action hints shown at the prompt.
2. Enter one command.
3. Review the result block.
4. Repeat until quest progression, victory, or quit.

General flow:
- talk to the Wise Old Man,
- clear swamp -> mountain -> castle route,
- handle goblin road encounter,
- defeat Makor, then the Onyx Witch,
- free and cleanse Elle.

## UI and Readability Features

### Dynamic action hints

At every input prompt, the game prints all valid actions with short descriptions based on your exact state.

Behavior:
- out of combat: all relevant world/inventory/progression actions,
- in combat: only combat-relevant actions for the active encounter.

### Color legend

| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Blue | Talkable NPC |
| Yellow | Fightable creature |
| Orange | Boss |
| Red | End-boss (King Makor, Onyx Witch) |
| Green | Item/equipment |
| Purple | Rare/quest/important reward item |
| Pink | Skill/stat terms (`attack`, `defense`, `health`, skill names) |

### Combat health bars

During combat, ASCII health bars are shown after attacks:
- green segment = current HP,
- red segment = missing HP.

Both player and enemy bars are displayed.

### Terminal clearing

The CLI clears the previous screen output each turn (to reduce clutter).

Env toggles:
- `BYTE_WORLD_AI_NO_CLEAR=1` disables clear behavior,
- `BYTE_WORLD_AI_FORCE_CLEAR=1` forces clear behavior when terminal checks fail.

## Combat System

### Turn structure

1. Player chooses an action.
2. If action consumes a turn and enemy survives, enemy acts.
3. Cooldowns tick after enemy turn.

### Key rules

- `defend` applies to next enemy hit only.
- some actions do not consume a turn (context-dependent item uses).
- movement/talking/training are blocked while encounter is active.

### Escape chances

- Normal enemies: ~65%
- Bosses: ~28%
- Goblin Army: ~22%

Failed escape triggers enemy turn.

### Encounter-specific mechanics

- **Goblin Army**: starts in negotiation phase with `joke`, `bribe`, or `fight`.
- **Onyx Witch**: starts with barrier active; normal attacks are blocked until Goblin Riddle is read/used.
- **Onyx Witch curse**: while barrier is active, enemy turns apply extra 4 HP drain.
- **King Makor**: if `Mysterious Ring` is in inventory, ring surge auto-activates at encounter start (`+4 ATK`, `+2 DEF` temporary bonus).

### Defeat behavior

On defeat:
- encounter ends,
- you respawn at `Old Shack`,
- HP is restored to 50% of effective max HP.

Extra penalty:
- versus Goblin Army, there is a 50% chance of permanent `-1` to one base stat (attack/defense/health).

## Progression and Stats

### Starting character

- Name: `Wanderer`
- Base max HP: `50`
- Base attack: `8`
- Base defense: `5`

## Items, Gear, and Training

### Equipment slots

- `weapon`
- `armor`
- `shield`
- `accessory`
- `aura`

### Best-in-slot auto-equip

`equip all` compares all owned equippable items and equips the strongest option per slot.

Scoring basis:
- attack bonus,
- defense bonus,
- max HP bonus (normalized),
- item value as tie-break support.

### Consumables

| Item | Effect |
|---|---|
| `Minor Potion` | Heal 18 HP |
| `Sturdy Bandage` | Heal 12 HP |

### Important quest/context items

| Item | Core purpose |
|---|---|
| `Crusty Key` | Frees Elle at Witch's Terrace after Witch defeat |
| `Goblin Riddle` | Breaks Onyx Witch barrier |
| `Vial of Tears` | Cleanses Elle and completes story |
| `Hoard of Treasure` | Turn in at Old Shack for 180 gold via `use hoard` |
| `Mysterious Ring` | Temporary combat surge (`+4 ATK`, `+2 DEF`) |

### Loot drop rules

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Guaranteed boss drops | Always drop |
| Extra loot-table roll (normal enemies) | 45% |
| Extra loot-table roll (bosses) | 70% |
| Rare boon roll (normal enemies) | 4% |
| Rare boon pool | `Moonbite Dagger`, `Echo Plate`, `Warding Totem`, `Skill Cache (+10/+20/+30)` |

### Training conversions

- `train attack 1` -> `+1` base ATK
- `train defense 1` -> `+1` base DEF
- `train health 1` -> `+3` base max HP

`train all` behavior:
- spends points in equal split,
- leftover points remain unspent.

## Tips for New Players

- Talk to the Wise Old Man immediately to unlock your core skill set.
- Farm Forest/Tunnel if first bosses feel too strong.
- Use `map` frequently to follow recommended route markers.
- Use `equip all` after major loot drops.
- Save healing items for bosses or failed escape outcomes.
- Against Onyx Witch, prioritize breaking barrier with `read goblin riddle` or `use goblin riddle`.
- If Goblin Army negotiation starts early, `joke` or `bribe` can bypass direct combat.

## FAQ

### Why can’t I move/talk/train right now?

You are likely in an active encounter. Resolve it with combat actions or `run`.

### Why am I not damaging the Onyx Witch?

Her barrier is active. Use/read Goblin Riddle in combat to break it first.

### Why did I wake up in Old Shack?

You were defeated in combat. Defeat causes respawn at Old Shack with partial HP.

### Can I continue after winning?

Yes. Main quest victory does not force quit.

### Is there save/load?

Not yet. Runs are session-based.
